# Bootstrap code for Sequencing.com's App Market API

This repo provides bootstrap libraries in various coding languages to make it easy to add Sequencing.com's [App Market API](https://sequencing.com/developer-documentation/app-market-api) to your system. 

The code in this repo enables your system to authenticate and communicate with [Sequencing.com](https://sequencing.com/). This allows you to sell your software app in Sequencing.com's App Market while hosting and running your software on your own system. Sequencing.com will make the user's genetic data available to you and your system processes it and provides the user with the results utilizing the same system you are using now.

Adding your app to Sequencing.com's App Market is always free and you receive 80% of all revenue generated from the sale of your app.
